What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google

	cons: sometime people will have a long time not to commit

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple

	git is used as development tools.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    	use git log to get id, and git diff to see the changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    	I could reroll it when error raise.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    	to write code
